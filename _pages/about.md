# About Me
I am a Ph.D. student in the Information and Computer Sciences (ICS) Department at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, advised by [Prof. Haopeng Zhang](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=DT_HlbYAAAAJ). I received my M.Eng from the College of Computing and Data Science (CCDS) at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), where I was advised by [Prof. Hui Siu Cheung](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=d4ZYx6gAAAAJ). Before that, I received my B.S. from the School of Mathematics at Hefei University of Technology.

My research primarily focuses on large language models (LLMs) and their applications to tasks such as text summarization and information extraction.
